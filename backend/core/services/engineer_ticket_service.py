"""An engineer's own queue: the tickets currently assigned to them, with priority and the
requester's contact details, plus their notes, status history and status changes.

Any other ticket (unassigned, someone else's, or reassigned away) is "not found", so an
engineer can't learn about tickets that aren't theirs.

The workflow engineers can move a ticket through (closing is for admins):
