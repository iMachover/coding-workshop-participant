"""Mock people and tickets so a fresh deployment has something to show. Demo use only.

Loaded by the setup task when invoked with "demo_data": true (see setup_tasks.py). Adds 2
engineers, 5 employees and 25 tickets across every status, dated over the last three
weeks, each with the notes and status history the app would have recorded.

Each ticket is written as the story of what happened to it, as events that happened some
hours after it was created. The ticket's final fields (status, assignee, timestamps,
blocked reason) are worked out from those events, so they always agree with its history.

None of these accounts can sign in: their password hash matches no password.
