# Postman Testing Guide

Manual API testing for the `core` service (Facilities Helpdesk API) in Postman.

> **Keep this file and [postman_collection.json](postman_collection.json) current.** Every time an API route is added or changed, update its section here with the method, URL, headers/auth, params, request body, expected response and common errors, and add or update its request (with tests) in the collection. Routes are defined in [backend/core/routers/](backend/core/routers/).

## Contents

- [Setup](#setup)
- [Conventions](#conventions)
- [Health](#health): `GET /health`, `GET /health/db`
- [Auth](#auth): `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me`
- [Locations](#locations): `GET /buildings`, `GET /buildings/{id}/floors`, `GET /floors/{id}/seats`
- [Tickets](#tickets): list, create, get, status history, notes (list/add), escalation
- [Admin](#admin): all tickets (filters, search, triage order), ticket details, notes, status history, engineers' workload, assigning, people and roles, closing or sending back resolved tickets, dashboard metrics
- [Engineer](#engineer): my queue (filters, triage order), ticket details, status history, notes (list/add), status changes (start, block, unblock, resolve, reopen)
- [Suggested test run](#suggested-test-run)

---

## Setup

### 1. Start the backend

```sh
cd backend/core && ../.venv/bin/uvicorn function:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Import the collection

In Postman: **Import** → choose [postman_collection.json](postman_collection.json). You get one folder per section below (Health, Auth, Locations, Tickets, Admin, Engineer, Admin - closing) with **110 requests**: every route's success case plus its common errors. Each request has tests.

**Run it all:** right-click the collection → **Run collection** → **Run**. Requests run top to bottom, and each one saves what the next ones need into collection variables:

| Variable | Set by | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | You (default `http://localhost:8000/api/core`) | Every URL |
| `email`, `otherEmail` | Register pre-request scripts (unique per run) | Register/Login |
| `accessToken` | Login | The `Authorization: Bearer` header (collection-level auth) |
| `otherAccessToken` | "Login - second user" | Checking you can't read another user's ticket |
| `userId` | Register, then Login | Checking `/auth/me` and the ticket's creator |
| `buildingId`, `floorId`, `seatId` | The three location lists | Create ticket |
| `ticketId` | Create ticket | Get / notes / escalation, and the Admin requests |
| `password`, `missingId` | Fixed | Login; ids that don't exist (`2147483647`) |
| `adminEmail`, `adminPassword` | **You** (see [step 3](#3-create-an-admin-and-two-engineers-for-the-admin-folder)) | Login - admin |
| `adminAccessToken`, `adminUserId` | Login - admin | The Admin folder's `Authorization: Bearer` header; checking admin accounts can't be changed |
| `engineerId`, `otherEngineerId` | List engineers (the first two) | Assign and reassign |
| `acknowledgedAt` | Assign ticket | Checking a reassignment keeps the first acknowledgement |
| `otherUserId` | List people - employee by email | Promoting the second user and moving them back; the Engineer folder's engineer |
| `engineerAccessToken` | Login - engineer | The Engineer folder's `Authorization: Bearer` header |
| `closeTicketId` | Setup - the employee reports another ticket | The Admin - closing folder's own ticket |
| `closedBefore` | Metrics - one ready to close | Checking the close shows up in `closed_last_7_days` |

A new user and ticket are created on each run, so it can be re-run without resetting the database. To send a single request by hand, run **Auth → Register** and **Login** first so `accessToken` is set. The token lasts 1 hour; after that, protected requests return 401 until you run **Login** again.

**Against AWS:** change the collection variable `baseUrl` to `https://<cloudfront-domain>/api/core` (the `VITE_API_URL` in `frontend/.env.local` + `/api/core`). If you use a Postman environment, only put `baseUrl` in it: an environment variable named `accessToken` or `ticketId` would override the ones the scripts save.

**From the command line** (same tests, no Postman app needed):

```sh
npx newman run postman_collection.json \
  --env-var adminEmail=facility.admin@acme.inc --env-var adminPassword=admin-pass-123
npx newman run postman_collection.json --env-var baseUrl=https://<cloudfront-domain>/api/core \
  --env-var adminEmail=<admin email> --env-var adminPassword=<admin password>
```

### 3. Create an admin and two engineers (for the Admin folder)

The Admin folder signs in as an existing Facility Admin, and its Assign subfolder assigns tickets to two existing engineers. There's no API to promote a user yet, so register them, then change their roles in SQL. Locally:

```sh
for who in "facility.admin@acme.inc|Facility Admin" "engineer1@acme.inc|Sam Tech" "engineer2@acme.inc|Kim Fixit"; do
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/core/auth/register -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"email\":\"${who%%|*}\",\"full_name\":\"${who##*|}\",\"password\":\"admin-pass-123\"}"
done
psql -U test -d codingworkshop -c "UPDATE users SET role_id = (SELECT role_id FROM roles WHERE role_name = 'admin') WHERE email = 'facility.admin@acme.inc';"
psql -U test -d codingworkshop -c "UPDATE users SET role_id = (SELECT role_id FROM roles WHERE role_name = 'engineer') WHERE email IN ('engineer1@acme.inc', 'engineer2@acme.inc');"
```

Then set the collection variables `adminEmail` and `adminPassword` to the admin account (or pass them with `--env-var` to newman, as above). Without them, **Login - admin** fails with "adminEmail and adminPassword are set" and the rest of the Admin folder is skipped. With fewer than two engineers, **List engineers** fails with "At least two engineers exist" and the Assign subfolder is skipped. Everything else still runs.

The Engineer folder needs no account of its own: with the admin token, it promotes the collection's second user to engineer, assigns them the ticket, and signs them in with the password it registered them with. Without the admin variables it's skipped too.

Every URL below is written as `{{baseUrl}}/...`.

---

## Conventions

### Authentication

Every route except health, register and login needs the access token from [Login](#login):

```
Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}
```

The collection sends it automatically: its **Authorization** tab is type *Bearer Token*, token `{{accessToken}}`. Requests that need something different (health, register, login, the 401 checks, the other-user check) override it on their own Authorization tab.

On every request the server verifies the token's signature and expiry, then reloads the user from the database. So a deleted account, or a role changed since sign-in, stops the token working at once. The old dev-only `X-User-Id` header is gone: sending it does nothing.

Routes also check the caller's **role**. `/tickets` is for employees; engineers and admins get 403 there. `/admin/...` is for Facility Admins; employees and engineers get 403 there. `/engineer/...` is for engineers; employees and admins get 403 there. `/auth/me` and the location lists work for every signed-in role.

### Request bodies

POST and PUT requests send JSON: **Body → raw → JSON**, which sets `Content-Type: application/json`.

### Error shapes

Business errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 409) return a single message:

```json
{ "detail": "Ticket not found" }
```

Validation errors (422) come from FastAPI and list every problem, with `loc` saying where it is (`body`, `query` or `path`):

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "string_too_short",
      "loc": ["body", "password"],
      "msg": "String should have at least 8 characters",
      "input": "short",
      "ctx": { "min_length": 8 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Errors any route can return

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | No `Authorization` header, or it isn't `Bearer <token>` (protected routes) | `{"detail":"Please sign in to continue."}` |
| 401 | Token malformed, tampered with, or signed with another secret | `{"detail":"Invalid token. Please sign in again."}` |
| 401 | Token older than 1 hour | `{"detail":"Your session has expired. Please sign in again."}` |
| 401 | The token's user was deleted | `{"detail":"Unknown user"}` |
| 401 | The user's role changed since sign-in | `{"detail":"Your access has changed. Please sign in again."}` |
| 403 | Valid token, but the role may not use this route | `{"detail":"You don't have access to this."}` |
| 404 | Route doesn't exist | `{"detail":"Not Found"}` |
| 405 | Wrong HTTP method for the path | `{"detail":"Method Not Allowed"}` |
| 422 | Path id is not a positive integer (e.g. `/tickets/abc`, `/tickets/0`) | FastAPI validation list |
| 500 | Unexpected server error. Details are logged, never returned | `{"detail":"Internal server error"}` |

### Enum values

| Field | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| `category` | `network`, `hardware`, `printer`, `hvac`, `electrical`, `furniture`, `building_facilities`, `other` |
| `urgency` | `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `affected_scope` | `me`, `floor`, `building` |
| `status` | `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `resolved`, `closed` |
| `role` | `employee`, `engineer`, `admin` |

## Health

### Health check

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/health` |
| **Auth** | None |

**Expected response: `200 OK`**

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### Database health check

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/health/db` |
| **Auth** | None |

**Expected response: `200 OK`**

```json
{ "status": "ok", "db": "ok" }
```

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 503 | Postgres is down or unreachable. It recovers on its own once Postgres is back | `{"status":"error","db":"unavailable"}` |

---

## Auth

### Register

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/auth/register` |
| **Auth** | None |
| **Headers** | `Content-Type: application/json` |

**Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `email` | string | yes | Must be `@acme.inc`, max 254. Trimmed and lowercased |
| `full_name` | string | yes | 1–100 chars after trimming |
| `phone_number` | string | no | 1–30 chars after trimming |
| `password` | string | yes | 8–128 chars |

```json
{
  "email": "jane.doe@acme.inc",
  "full_name": "Jane Doe",
  "phone_number": "555-0101",
  "password": "hunter2hunter2"
}
```

**Expected response: `201 Created`.** The role is always `employee`. The password hash is never returned.

```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "email": "jane.doe@acme.inc",
  "full_name": "Jane Doe",
  "phone_number": "555-0101",
  "role": "employee",
  "created_at": "2026-09-22T20:21:06.105106-04:00"
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 409 | Email already registered (case-insensitive) | `{"detail":"An account with this email already exists"}` |
| 422 | Non-`@acme.inc` email | `msg: "Value error, Email must be an @acme.inc address"` |
| 422 | Password under 8 chars, blank `full_name`, missing field | FastAPI validation list |

### Login

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/auth/login` |
| **Auth** | None |
| **Headers** | `Content-Type: application/json` |

**Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `email` | string | yes | Max 254. Case-insensitive |
| `password` | string | yes | Max 128 |

```json
{ "email": "jane.doe@acme.inc", "password": "hunter2hunter2" }
```

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** A signed access token (JWT, HS256) plus the same user object as Register. The collection saves `access_token` into `{{accessToken}}` and `user.user_id` into `{{userId}}`. **Login - second user** does the same for the second user, into `{{otherAccessToken}}`.

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxIiwicm9sZSI6ImVtcGxveWVlIiwi...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "user": {
    "user_id": 1,
    "email": "jane.doe@acme.inc",
    "full_name": "Jane Doe",
    "phone_number": "555-0101",
    "role": "employee",
    "created_at": "2026-09-22T20:21:06.105106-04:00"
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `access_token` | Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. It is signed with the user id and role from the database at login. |
| `token_type` | Always `bearer` |
| `expires_in` | Seconds until the token expires (1 hour). After that, sign in again. |

The token's payload holds only `sub` (user id), `role`, `iat` (issued at), `exp` (expires at) and `iss` (`facilities-helpdesk`): no password, email or name. Paste a token into [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to see its claims. It's signed, not encrypted, so anyone can read it but nobody can change it without the secret.

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | Wrong email **or** wrong password. The message is the same on purpose, so it doesn't reveal which emails exist | `{"detail":"Invalid email or password"}` |
| 422 | Missing `email` or `password` | FastAPI validation list |

### Current user

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/auth/me` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}` |

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Same user object as Login, read fresh from the database. Works for every role.

**Errors:** 401 only, for each reason in [Errors any route can return](#errors-any-route-can-return). The collection checks four of them: no token, the old `X-User-Id` header on its own, a value that isn't a JWT, and a real token whose payload was edited to say `admin` (the signature no longer matches). Expiry, a deleted user and a changed role need the server's secret or the database, so they're covered by `backend/core/tests/test_auth.py` instead.

---

## Locations

These feed the Building → Floor → Seat dropdowns. All of them need a token; any signed-in role may call them.

### List buildings

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/buildings` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}` |

**Expected response: `200 OK`**

```json
[
  { "building_id": 1, "building_name": "Building A" },
  { "building_id": 2, "building_name": "Building B" }
]
```

**Errors:** 401 (see [above](#errors-any-route-can-return)).

### List floors in a building

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/buildings/:building_id/floors` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}` |
| **Path params** | `building_id`: positive integer |

**Expected response: `200 OK`**

```json
[
  { "floor_id": 1, "floor_number": 1, "building_id": 1 },
  { "floor_id": 2, "floor_number": 2, "building_id": 1 },
  { "floor_id": 3, "floor_number": 3, "building_id": 1 }
]
```

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | Missing, invalid or expired token | see [above](#errors-any-route-can-return) |
| 404 | Building doesn't exist | `{"detail":"Building not found"}` |
| 422 | `building_id` not a positive integer | `loc: ["path","building_id"]` |

### List seats on a floor

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/floors/:floor_id/seats` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}` |
| **Path params** | `floor_id`: positive integer |

**Expected response: `200 OK`**

```json
[
  { "seat_id": 3, "seat_number": "301", "floor_id": 3 },
  { "seat_id": 8, "seat_number": "302", "floor_id": 3 }
]
```

Seat ids aren't sequential within a floor. Always take them from this response.

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | Missing, invalid or expired token | see [above](#errors-any-route-can-return) |
| 404 | Floor doesn't exist | `{"detail":"Floor not found"}` |
| 422 | `floor_id` not a positive integer | `loc: ["path","floor_id"]` |

---

## Tickets

Every ticket route acts on behalf of the token's user and is **employee-only**: engineers and admins get `403 {"detail":"You don't have access to this."}` (admins use [their own routes](#admin); engineers' come later). Employees only ever see **their own** tickets: someone else's ticket returns **404, not 403**, so its existence isn't revealed. The server stores an internal `priority` (P1–P3) for engineers and admins, and it never appears in these responses.

### List my tickets

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/tickets` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}` |

**Query params** (all optional, combined with AND)

| Param | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `active`, `closed` | `active` = everything not closed (resolved tickets still show) |
| `status` | `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `resolved`, `closed` | |
| `urgency` | `low`, `medium`, `high` | |
| `q` | text, max 100 | Case-insensitive match on title or short description, or an exact ticket id |

Examples: `{{baseUrl}}/tickets?view=active&urgency=high`, `{{baseUrl}}/tickets?q=printer`

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Sorted by most recently updated first. Returns `[]` when nothing matches.

```json
[
  {
    "ticket_id": 1,
    "title": "Wi-Fi keeps dropping",
    "short_description": "Disconnects every few minutes",
    "category": "network",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "urgency": "medium",
    "affected_scope": "me",
    "escalation_requested": false,
    "building_id": 1,
    "building_name": "Building A",
    "floor_id": 3,
    "floor_number": 3,
    "seat_id": 3,
    "seat_number": "301",
    "created_at": "2026-09-22T20:35:34.471658-04:00",
    "updated_at": "2026-09-22T22:16:17.499763-04:00"
  }
]
```

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | Missing, invalid or expired token | see [above](#errors-any-route-can-return) |
| 403 | Signed in as an engineer or admin | `{"detail":"You don't have access to this."}` |
| 422 | Unknown value (e.g. `status=done`) | FastAPI validation list |
| 422 | Unknown parameter, **including `priority`** | `type: "extra_forbidden"`, `loc: ["query","priority"]` |

### Create a ticket

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/tickets` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}` |
| **Headers** | `Content-Type: application/json` |

**Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | yes | 1–150 chars after trimming |
| `short_description` | string | yes | 1–280 chars after trimming |
| `description` | string | yes | 1–5000 chars after trimming |
| `category` | enum | yes | See [Enum values](#enum-values) |
| `urgency` | enum | yes | `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `affected_scope` | enum | yes | `me`, `floor`, `building` |
| `building_id` | integer | yes | Must exist |
| `floor_id` | integer | if scope is `floor` or `me` | Must be in `building_id` |
| `seat_id` | integer | if scope is `me` | Must be on `floor_id`. Needs `floor_id` |

The server sets `status` (`open`), the creator (from the token) and the internal priority (building → P1, floor → P2, me → P3). Sending `status`, `priority` or `created_by_user_id` in the body has no effect.

```json
{
  "title": "Wi-Fi keeps dropping",
  "short_description": "Disconnects every few minutes",
  "description": "Since this morning my laptop loses Wi-Fi every 5-10 minutes.",
  "category": "network",
  "urgency": "medium",
  "affected_scope": "me",
  "building_id": 1,
  "floor_id": 3,

### List status history

Every status the ticket has been in, **oldest first**, and who changed it. The first row is the ticket's creation (`from_status: null`). A reopened ticket shows it as its own step, e.g. `resolved` → `open`, with the reason if one was given.

    "changed_at": "2026-09-22T20:35:34.471658-04:00"
  }
]
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `from_status` | `null` only on the creation row; otherwise a [status](#enum-values) |
| `to_status` | The status the ticket moved to |
| `changed_by_*` | Who made the change: the employee at creation, an engineer or admin after that |
| `reason` | Optional, e.g. why it was blocked or reopened |

Nothing in the API changes status yet (engineer/admin endpoints come later), so a new ticket has exactly one row.

**Errors:** same as [Get one of my tickets](#get-one-of-my-tickets) (404 / 422 / 401 / 403).

### List notes on a ticket

| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/tickets/:ticket_id/notes` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}` |

## Admin

Facility Admin routes. **Admin-only**: employees and engineers get `403 {"detail":"You don't have access to this."}`. Admins see **every** ticket, whoever created it, including its internal `priority` (P1–P3). Admins can [assign tickets](#assign-or-reassign-a-ticket) to engineers and [move people between employee and engineer](#change-someones-role), and [close resolved tickets or send them back](#close-or-send-back-a-resolved-ticket). Admin notes aren't built.

The **Admin - closing** folder runs after the Engineer folder, with its own ticket: the employee reports it, the admin assigns it to the Engineer folder's engineer, and it goes through start, resolve, send back, resolve again and close.

In the collection, the Admin folder's Authorization tab is `Bearer {{adminAccessToken}}`, saved by **Login - admin**. Create the admin account first ([Setup step 3](#3-create-an-admin-and-two-engineers-for-the-admin-folder)).

### List all tickets

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/admin/tickets` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{adminAccessToken}}` |

**Query params** (all optional, combined with AND)

| Param | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `active`, `closed` | `active` = everything not closed |
| `status` | `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `resolved`, `closed` | |
| `priority` | `P1`, `P2`, `P3` | |
| `urgency` | `low`, `medium`, `high` | |
| `category` | see [Enum values](#enum-values) | |
| `building_id` | positive integer | An unknown building just matches nothing |
| `assignment` | `unassigned`, `assigned` | `unassigned` is the dashboard's triage queue |
| `assigned_to` | positive integer | One engineer's user id |
| `escalated` | `true`, `false` | Tickets the employee asked an admin to review |
| `q` | text, max 100 | Case-insensitive match on title, short description, **requester name or email**, or an exact ticket id |

Examples: `{{baseUrl}}/admin/tickets?assignment=unassigned`, `{{baseUrl}}/admin/tickets?escalated=true&view=active`, `{{baseUrl}}/admin/tickets?q=eve%20other`

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Sorted for triage: **priority first (P1, P2, P3), then the oldest created first**. Each row is the [employee list](#list-my-tickets) row plus `priority`, `created_by_user_id`, `created_by_name`, `assigned_to_user_id` and `assigned_to_name`. Returns `[]` when nothing matches.

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|

| 401 | Missing, invalid or expired token | see [above](#errors-any-route-can-return) |
| 403 | Signed in as an employee or engineer | `{"detail":"You don't have access to this."}` |

Filters combine with AND, so contradictory ones (`assignment=unassigned&assigned_to=4`) return `[]`, not an error.

### Get any ticket (admin)

### List status history of any ticket (admin)

### List engineers (workload)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/admin/engineers` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{adminAccessToken}}` |

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Every user with the engineer role and their **active** tickets: open, in progress or blocked (resolved and closed don't count), split by status, plus how many are P1. Sorted **lightest load first**, then fewer P1s, then by name. Engineers with nothing assigned are included with every count at 0. Returns `[]` when there are no engineers.

```json

**Errors:** 401 (missing, invalid or expired token, see [above](#errors-any-route-can-return)), 403 (employee or engineer).

### Assign or reassign a ticket

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `PUT` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/admin/tickets/:ticket_id/assignment` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{adminAccessToken}}` |
| **Path params** | `ticket_id`: positive integer |

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `engineer_id` | integer | yes | A user whose role is `engineer` (see [List engineers](#list-engineers-workload)) |

```json
{ "engineer_id": 3 }
```

What it changes:

- `assigned_to_user_id` → the engineer, and `assigned_at` → now (every time, so it records when the current engineer got it).
- `acknowledged_at` → now on the **first** assignment only; a reassignment keeps the first value.
- `updated_at` → now.
- `status` does **not** change: the engineer moves it to In Progress. No status history row is written.

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** The updated ticket, in the [admin details](#get-any-ticket-admin) shape.

```json
{
  "ticket_id": 1,
  "title": "Lobby lights out",
  "short_description": "x",
  "description": "y",
  "category": "electrical",
  "urgency": "high",
  "affected_scope": "building",
  "status": "open",
  "building_id": 1,
  "floor_id": null,
  "seat_id": null,
  "created_by_user_id": 1,
  "assigned_to_user_id": 3,
  "escalation_requested": false,
  "escalation_reason": null,
  "blocked_reason": null,
  "created_at": "2026-09-23T14:28:06.079789-04:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-09-23T14:28:06.138246-04:00",
  "acknowledged_at": "2026-09-23T14:28:06.138246-04:00",
  "assigned_at": "2026-09-23T14:28:06.138246-04:00",

  "priority": "P1",
  "created_by_name": "Jane Doe",
  "created_by_email": "jane.doe@acme.inc",
  "created_by_phone": null
}
```

After a reassignment to Kim: `assigned_to_name` becomes `"Kim Fixit"`, `assigned_at` moves to the new time (`...14:28:06.172424...`) and `acknowledged_at` stays `...14:28:06.138246...`.

**Errors** (checked in this order)

|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |

**Query params** (both optional, combined with AND)

| Param | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `role` | `employee`, `engineer`, `admin` | |
| `q` | text, max 100 | Case-insensitive match on name or email |

Example: `{{baseUrl}}/admin/users?role=employee&q=jane`

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Everyone, sorted by name, with their role and `active_ticket_count`: tickets assigned to them that are open, in progress or blocked. Never includes the password hash. Returns `[]` when nothing matches.

```json
[

```

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|

| 403 | Signed in as an employee or engineer | `{"detail":"You don't have access to this."}` |

### Change someone's role

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `PUT` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/admin/users/:user_id/role` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{adminAccessToken}}` |
| **Path params** | `user_id`: positive integer |

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `role` | string | yes | `employee` or `engineer`. Admin accounts are only set up outside the app, so `admin` is a 422. |

```json
{ "role": "engineer" }
```

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** The person, updated, in the [List people](#list-people) shape.

```json
{
  "user_id": 3,
  "email": "jane.doe@acme.inc",
  "full_name": "Jane Doe",
  "phone_number": null,
  "role": "engineer",
  "created_at": "2026-09-23T15:02:39.486212-04:00",
  "active_ticket_count": 0
}
```

The change **signs that person out**: their current token no longer matches their role, so their next request gets `401 {"detail":"Your access has changed. Please sign in again."}`. Once they sign in again, their new token has the new role.

**Errors** (checked in this order)

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 404 | User doesn't exist | `{"detail":"User not found"}` |
| 403 | The user is an admin, including yourself | `{"detail":"Admin accounts can't be changed here"}` |
| 409 | They already have that role | `{"detail":"Jane Doe is already an engineer"}` |
| 409 | An engineer who still has active tickets, back to employee. Reassign their tickets first. | `{"detail":"Sam Tech still has 1 active ticket. Reassign them first."}` |
| 422 | `role` missing, or not `employee`/`engineer` | `loc: ["body","role"]` |
| 422 | `user_id` not a positive integer | `loc: ["path","user_id"]` |

| 403 | Signed in as an employee or engineer | `{"detail":"You don't have access to this."}` |

### Close or send back a resolved ticket

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/admin/tickets/:ticket_id/status` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{adminAccessToken}}` |
| **Path params** | `ticket_id`: positive integer |

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | yes | `closed` (close it) or `in_progress` (send it back to its engineer) |
| `reason` | string | to send back | Trimmed; 1–500 characters. What's still wrong when sending back; an optional note when closing. |

```json
{ "status": "in_progress", "reason": "Two lights still flicker" }
```

What it changes, in one transaction:

- **Close:** `status` → `closed`. `resolved_at` is kept. Closed is final: no more notes, status changes or assignments.
- **Send back:** `status` → `in_progress` with the **same engineer**, and `resolved_at` is cleared. The engineer sees it in their queue again.
- Either way, a status history row with the admin as `changed_by` and the reason. The employee and the engineer see it.

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** The updated ticket, in the [Get any ticket (admin)](#get-any-ticket-admin) shape. After closing:

| 409 | Already closed | `{"detail":"This ticket is already closed"}` |
| 409 | Not resolved yet (open, in progress, blocked) | `{"detail":"Only resolved tickets can be closed"}` / `{"detail":"Only resolved tickets can be sent back"}` |
| 409 | Sending back, but its engineer has since been made an employee (resolved tickets can't be reassigned) | `{"detail":"Sam Tech is no longer an engineer, so it can't go back to them. Close it, or make them an engineer again."}` |

### Dashboard metrics

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/admin/metrics` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{adminAccessToken}}` |

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Headline counts. "Active" means not closed, the same as [List all tickets](#list-all-tickets)' `view=active`, so each count matches the list you get with its filter:

| Key | Counts | Same as |
|---|---|---|
| `unassigned` | Active tickets with no engineer | `?assignment=unassigned&view=active` |
| `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `resolved` | Tickets in that status | `?status=…` |
| `active_p1` | Active P1 tickets | `?priority=P1&view=active` |
| `escalated` | Active tickets the employee escalated | `?escalated=true&view=active` |
| `closed_last_7_days` | Tickets closed in the last 7 days (from the status history, since tickets don't store a close time) | |

```json
{
  "unassigned": 0,
  "open": 0,
  "in_progress": 0,
  "blocked": 0,
  "resolved": 0,
  "active_p1": 0,
  "escalated": 0,
  "closed_last_7_days": 1
}
```

**Errors:** 401 (missing, invalid or expired token, see [above](#errors-any-route-can-return)), 403 (employee or engineer).

---

## Engineer

An engineer's own queue. **Engineer-only**: employees and admins get `403 {"detail":"You don't have access to this."}`. Every route acts on the tickets **currently assigned to the caller**. Any other ticket (unassigned, someone else's, reassigned away, or missing) returns **404, not 403**, so its existence isn't revealed. Rows and details use the same shapes as the admin routes, so they include `priority` and the requester's contact details. Engineers [move their tickets through the workflow](#change-a-tickets-status-engineer); closing is for admins.

In the collection, the Engineer folder's Authorization tab is `Bearer {{engineerAccessToken}}`, saved by **Login - engineer**. Its first two requests use the admin token to set up the engineer (see [Setup step 3](#3-create-an-admin-and-two-engineers-for-the-admin-folder)).

### My queue

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/engineer/tickets` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{engineerAccessToken}}` |

**Query params** (all optional, combined with AND)

| Param | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `active`, `closed` | `active` = everything not closed; leave it out for all |
| `status` | `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `resolved`, `closed` | |
| `priority` | `P1`, `P2`, `P3` | |
| `building_id` | positive integer | |
| `q` | text, max 100 | Case-insensitive match on title, short description, requester name or email, or an exact ticket id |

There's no assignee filter, because the queue is always the caller's: `assigned_to`, like any unknown parameter, is a 422.

Examples: `{{baseUrl}}/engineer/tickets?view=active`, `{{baseUrl}}/engineer/tickets?priority=P1&q=lobby`

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Sorted for triage: **priority first (P1, P2, P3), then the oldest created first**. Same row shape as [List all tickets](#list-all-tickets). Returns `[]` when nothing matches or nothing is assigned yet.

|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/engineer/tickets/:ticket_id/history` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{engineerAccessToken}}` |
| **Path params** | `ticket_id`: positive integer |

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** Same shape as [List status history](#list-status-history), oldest first.

**Errors:** same as [Get one of my tickets (engineer)](#get-one-of-my-tickets-engineer) (404 / 422 / 401 / 403).

### Notes (engineer)

List every note on one of your tickets (from the employee and engineers, oldest first), or add one.

| | List | Add |
|---|---|---|
| **Method** | `GET` | `POST` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/engineer/tickets/:ticket_id/notes` | same |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{engineerAccessToken}}` | same |
| **Body** | none | `{"note_text": "..."}` |

**Request body** (add)

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `note_text` | string | yes | Trimmed; 1–2000 characters |

```json
{ "note_text": "Replacing the breaker this afternoon." }
```

**Expected response: `201 Created`** (add), in the [List notes on a ticket](#list-notes-on-a-ticket) shape. The employee sees it in their own notes list, and it moves the ticket's `updated_at` forward. Listing returns `200 OK` with every note.

```json
{
  "note_id": 1,
  "ticket_id": 1,
  "user_id": 2,
  "author_name": "Sam Tech",
  "author_role": "engineer",
  "note_text": "Replacing the breaker this afternoon.",
  "created_at": "2026-09-23T16:47:56.987070-04:00"
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 404 | Ticket doesn't exist or isn't assigned to you | `{"detail":"Ticket not found"}` |
| 409 | Adding to a closed ticket | `{"detail":"Closed tickets can't take new notes"}` |

### Change a ticket's status (engineer)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **URL** | `{{baseUrl}}/engineer/tickets/:ticket_id/status` |
| **Auth** | `Authorization: Bearer {{engineerAccessToken}}` |
| **Path params** | `ticket_id`: positive integer |

The workflow engineers can move a ticket through (closing is for admins):

```
open --start--> in_progress --resolve--> resolved
                  |    ^                    |
           block  |    | unblock            | reopen
                  v    |                    v
                 blocked                in_progress
```

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | yes | `in_progress` (start, unblock or reopen), `blocked` or `resolved` |
| `reason` | string | for `blocked` and `resolved` | Trimmed; 1–500 characters. Why the work is paused, or what was done. Optional for `in_progress`. |

```json
{ "status": "blocked", "reason": "Waiting on a replacement Wi-Fi card" }
```

What it changes, all in one transaction:

- `status` → the new status, and `updated_at` → now.
- `blocked_reason` → the reason while blocked, cleared on any other move.
- `resolved_at` → now on resolve, cleared on reopen.
- A status history row with the old and new status, the engineer, and the reason. The employee sees it in [their history](#list-status-history).

**Expected response: `200 OK`.** The updated ticket, in the [Get one of my tickets (engineer)](#get-one-of-my-tickets-engineer) shape.
